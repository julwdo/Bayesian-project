\section{Introduction}

\section{}

The first objective of this project was to replicate the analysis conducted by Dudley. The dataset used comprises insurance claim amounts exceeding 1.5 million over a period of five years from an automobile insurance portfolio. The data, originally presented in Rytgaard (1990), is shown in Table 1.

\item Note:\ The threshold of 1.5 million corresponds to the retention level of an excess-of-loss insurance policy\footnote{To manage risk exposure, insurers frequently employ reinsurance strategies, which help limit their financial liability on large claims. Under such arrangements, if a claim amount \( y \) exceeds a predetermined threshold \( d \) (the retention), the insurer is responsible only for paying up to \( d \), while any excess \( y - d \) is covered by the reinsurer. This approach helps insurers mitigate the impact of high-variance claims. A related practice involves using deductibles to avoid processing numerous small claims. Since handling minor claims can be disproportionately expensive, insurers may impose a deductible---requiring policyholders to cover costs up to \( d \). In some cases, a franchise deductible is used instead: here, the insurer pays the entire claim \( y \) only if it exceeds the threshold \( d \).}.

\end{table}

To model this data, the following mathematical notation was introduced. Let \( N_t \) denote the number of claims in year \( t \), and let \( Y_{i,t} \) represent the amount of the \( i \)-th claim in year \( t \), where \( i = 1, 2, \ldots, N_t \). The aggregate claim amount in year \( t \) is then given by

\[
S_t = Y_{1,t} + Y_{2,t} + \cdots + Y_{N_t,t}.
\]

To proceed, certain assumptions about the distributions of \( N_t \) and \( Y_{i,t} \) were necessary. It was assumed that claims occur at a constant rate over time at random. Therefore, the number of claims \( N_t \) was modeled using a Poisson distribution. Since the individual claim amounts \( Y_{i,t} \) are positive and may include large outliers, a loss distribution with a heavy tail was needed. Consequently, the Pareto distribution was selected to model \( Y_{i,t} \). Hence,

\[
N_t \sim \text{Poisson}(\theta), \quad 0 < \theta < \infty,
\]
\[
Y_{i,t} \sim \text{Pareto}(\alpha, \beta), \quad \alpha > 0, \quad 0 < \beta < y.
\]

In the Pareto distribution, the parameter \( \beta \) determines the minimum possible value of \( y \), meaning the support of the distribution is \( [\beta, \infty) \). This is particularly appropriate in our context, as we are modeling insurance claims that exceed a specific threshold.

Additional assumptions were made: \( N_t \) was assumed to be independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) across \( t \); \( Y_{i,t} \) were i.i.d. across both indices \( i \) and \( t \); and \( N_t \) and \( Y_{i,t} \) were assumed to be independent for all \( i \) and \( t \). Under these assumptions, \( S_t \) follows a compound Poisson distribution, since it represents the sum of independent Pareto-distributed random variables.
